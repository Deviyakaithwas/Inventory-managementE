# Inventory-managementE
inventory-management-system
********************

I developed this project using Java since I am applying for a Java developer position. Although the tech stack listed below is different, I chose to utilize Java.

-Scenario: Create an Inventory Management utility with an additional feature to fetch item details from an external API. The utility should allow users to add, edit, delete, and list inventory items. It should also provide functionality to fetch item details (like price, and supplier info) from an external API based on the item's ID or name.

Requirements:
***************
- User Interface: Design an intuitive UI using Yii2, incorporating AJAX for dynamic data loading and updates.
- Database Interaction: Use MySQL as the database and use Yii2’s Active Record for database operations with tables like items, categories, and item_details.
- CRUD Operations: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for inventory items.
- API Integration:  Integrate an external API to fetch additional details for inventory items.  Store the fetched data in the local database and display it in the UI.
- Validation and Error Handling: Ensure server-side validation for all forms and robust error handling, especially for API interactions.
- Authentication and Security: Implement secure user authentication and ensure the security of API interactions.
- Documentation: Include clear documentation on API integration, how to set up the project, and any external libraries or tools used.
